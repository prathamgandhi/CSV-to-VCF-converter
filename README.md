# CSV-to-VCF-converter
A python-based script that converts a CSV file containing contact information of different people to a VCF file.

A python interpreter must be already installed on the user's system to be able to run this script. In the script it has been assumed that the input and output files are already present in the same folder as the script, if that is not the case the path in the script has to be changed accordingly.

The script is to be modified slightly depending upon the use-case.
